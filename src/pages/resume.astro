			<h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p>
                I am a goal oriented, laid-back, honest person, and I'm looking
                for a position where I can make a difference in the industry.
                When my career is finished and I decide to retire, I want to
                become a professor at a local college and help usher in a new
                generation of software engineers. I'm a fast and willing learner
                and love learning about new tech.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know many technologies but here are some of the ones I'm best
                at:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>I used Next.js to maintain the <a href="/projects/studioarchetype-site">Studio Archetype website</a>.</li>
                <li>I used Vue to build the <a href="/projects/holoui-builder">HoloUI Builder</a>.</li>
                <li>I used Kotlin to build the API for <a href="/projects/timezonedb">TimezoneDB</a>.</li>

                    <p>
                        I attended Kickapoo High School in Springfield, Missouri
                        between 2017 and 2020. While I was there I recieved my
                        high school diploma and participated in the school's
                        computer programming club, run by the CS teacher, Scott
                        Neeman. I participated in the A+ program which required
                        me to tutor classes, so I tutored Intro to CS for Mr.
                        Neeman.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my time in the computer programming club we
                        participated in many local and state competitions. In
                        2018, we participated and placed 3rd in Springfield's
                        annual Hack4Good competition. Later that year, Our team
                        placed 4th in the statewide <a href="https://www.more.net/professional-development/missouri-high-school-cyber-security-challenge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MORENet cybersecurity challenge</a>,
                        and we met Governor Mike Parson after the challenge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In early 2019, we went to the <a href="https://www.sbuniv.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SBU</a>
                        competition in Bolivar. There were some technical
                        difficulties with the judge software so nobody did very
                        well, but we still enjoyed our time there. The same year,
                        we attended Hack4Good again and placed 5th.

                        I spent a semester of my senior year in high school
                        attending OTC, a local community college in the
                        mornings. I took three CS classes as part of a school
                        program where I earned dual credit.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I spent the time between May 2020 and October 2021 working small
                jobs at local stores to pay my bills and fuel my personal
                projects, most of which are <a href="https://github.com/LizAinslie" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open source</a>.
                I also spent this time figuring out my identity and dealing with
                some personal mental health problems.

                    <p>
                        In October of 2021 I signed a contract set up by a close
                        personal friend to do some web development for <a href="https://studioarchetype.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Studio Archetype</a>
                        and <a href="https://continuum.graphics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Continuum Graphics</a>.
                        So far this has been a good fit, but I encountered some
                        housing issues in Missouri so I moved to Arizona to be
                        closer to work and I'm finding this is less good of a
                        fit for me as it initially seemed, so I'm looking for a
                        more traditional remote position I can keep across a
                        move out of the US.

            <!-- <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I have a lot of different interests and as such, I've learned a
                lot in my time writing software. I can write a full-stack
                application and deploy it alone, along with its dependencies,
                such as databases. Below is a breakdown of the different
                technologies I'm familiar with.

                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I'm a very capable programmer in backend and desktop
                        scenarios. I've known Java since I was 10 and I
                        consistently use Kotlin to write API services. I also
                        use Java/Kotlin to mod games and write desktop software.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I'm also very skilled using Node to write API services
                        and have been doing so for nearly five years. I know
                        Electron well but prefer other solutions to desktop
                        software like C++ or Java.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I know C and C++ fairly well, and have used them in some
                        desktop software, as well as to write my own languages.
                        I know how to use the QT libraries to write maintainable
                        user interfaces in C++ or QML. I've also been working on
                        my own operating systems in my free time, which involves
                        mostly C and Assembly.

                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I have minor experience with Golang, and I've used Dart
                        substantially. I have experience with Python and Ruby,
                        and have used Python to build APIs in the past. I'm also
                        interested in learning Elixir or Erlang.

                        I'm familiar with many Kotlin and Java libraries
                        including Lombok, SLF4J, Spark, Ktor, and the Kotlinx
                        tools. I am capable of writing serialization strategies
                        with GSON, Jackson, and Kotlinx Serialization. I know
                        how to build user interfaces with Jetpack Compose and
                        Swing/AWT.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I can effectively use the Android SDK to build complex
                        mobile apps as well as Flutter for cross platform apps.
                        I can also use Ionic and Capacitor to build apps, and
                        these technologies are the first ones I used to do so.

                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I've been using Express and related libraries to build
                        NodeJS APIs for 4 years, and I know how to utilize
                        Database connectors like Prisma and Mongoose in this
                        kind of software.

                        I'm familiar with React, Vue, Next, and Astro, and these
                        technologies make up most of the projects I've worked
                        on. I also know how to integrate libraries like Redux,
                        Pinia, VueX for state management, and I can pick up
                        libraries for other things easily. I'm good at making
                        canvas and WebGL animations, too.

                    <p class="mt-2 noMargin">
                        I've used Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Bulma, and Tailwind in
                        all sorts of software I have written, and I'm
                        comfortable writing my own styles when the project calls
                        for it.

                        languages, including Pug and Handlebars, and have used
                        both Sass/SCSS and Less to render stylesheets in a
