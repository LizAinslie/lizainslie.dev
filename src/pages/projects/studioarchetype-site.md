# Studio Archetype Website
I'm in charge of maintaining the website for a creator company known as
[Studio Archetype][archetype_site].

## Technologies Used
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - Framework
- [Braintree][braintree_site] - Payments
- [Tailwind CSS][tailwind_site] - Styles

## Problems I Solved
When I was hired the site was left in an unfinished state from a previous dev
who flaked. I was immediately tasked with cleaning up his codebase.

### Payment System
The previous dev was hired to implement [Braintree][braintree_site] payments and
had left this unfinished and broken. I cleaned up his code and made payments
through Braintree work. We had previously been using PayPal but wanted to cut
fees.

### Messy Styles
The previous developer(s) used [Tailwind CSS][tailwind_site] to author styles on
the site. This was my first time using Tailwind so I learned how it worked and
started cleaning up. The codebase became much easier to manage after that.

## Takeaways
When I started working on this project, I learned how to quickly pick up where a
previous developer left off, and how to incrementally improve and modernize an
older codebase.
