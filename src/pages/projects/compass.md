# Compass
A simple & straightforward, no-BS compass app that works with your Material You
colors. Nothing more, nothing less!

## Project Motivation
I do security work as a fourth job and having a proper compass helps. I tried 
finding a good option on the Play Store but they all contain ads or shill other
apps. I just needed something that'd give me a general direction and (when I
need it) my exact bearing, so that's why I made this. I also made it draw colors
from your Material You theme so it looks amazing!

## Technologies Used
- [Jetpack Compose for Android](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) -
An awesome Android UI framework for Kotlin, made by JetBrains in partnership
with Google.

## Takeaways
The Google Play Store approval process is shit. No wonder mobile developers hate
their job. Between the process Apple requires and the dumb things Google's
review team do it's a headache getting your app on the market.
