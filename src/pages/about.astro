			<h2>Hi, I'm Lizzy! üëã</h2>
			<p>
				I am a 19 year old full stack engineer and business owner from 
				Arizona üåµ. My hobbies include video games, writing systems code,
				making music, and Dungeons & Dragons. I identify as transgender
				(MtF) and I use She/They pronouns. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
			</p>

			<h3>How to contact me</h3>
			
			<p>
				I'm generally open to chat with anyone as long as you can hold a
				proper adult conversation (it's the internet, you'd be surprised).
				If you want to reach me for any reason, (i.e. just to chat, to 
				discuss business, to play a game) you can use one of the following
				methods:

			<h3>Want to donate?</h3>

				Because of my slightly shaky financial state as of recently, I
				do accept donations. However I ask that before donating you
				make sure you take care of your own needs and the needs of your
				friends/loved ones. If anything I do or make helps you in any
				way, shoot me a message! I love hearing how my creations make
				people's lives better. You can donate using the sites below:
