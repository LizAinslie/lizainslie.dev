# Why I still deadname "Meta"
People often ask why I still use the name "Facebook" for what is now Meta. There
are a few key reasons I don't feel like the company is justified in their change
of name.

## I don't believe in the "metaverse"
There are a lot of problems that I see preventing the metaverse from being
completed. 

Firstly, we're nearing a global bandwidth crisis and a system such as the
metaverse will require tons of bandwidth. From a technical standpoint, to
accomplish what Meta hopes to accomplish, you need to be able to stream assets
quick and uninterrupted to a user's device in mere milliseconds. Most of the
world doesn't have the bandwidth capacity to do this properly even now, and with
such a shortage nearing this will only get worse.

Secondly, VR equipment is underdeveloped and expensive. It's too much of an
investment for most people to move large chunks of their daily life to an
ecosystem designed primarily for hobbyists, such as VR. The same goes for most
companies: A business can buy two employees a new zoom-capable laptop or
Chromebook as compared to getting one employee a VR headset, and that's
optimistically speaking, based on the cheaper headset options.

Thirdly, everyone and their mother thinks this is a joke, and it definitely
feels like one. The tech isn't ripe enough yet, the only live demonstrations
that have been released are all super hacky and bad, and the entire thing
honestly just looks like shit (Sorry metaverse fans). Nobody wants to look at an
eyesore and the graphics I've seen so far definitely qualify as an eyesore. 
Proponents will argue that it will improve over time, but given the history of
 graphical improvement in VR, it's going to take a while.

Lastly, people who experience motion sickness and other disabilities will have
trouble accessing the metaverse. If done right, it will enable such people to
experience and do things they previously could only dream of. However,
realistically speaking, companies like Meta don't put a ton of thought towards
accessible technology right away, and especially not as a first party concern.
For example, Twitter, after 13 years of operation, just added an alternate text
for image uploads. Alt text has been an accessibility feature in browsers for
nearly as long as browsers could display images. Facebook *still* doesn't have
such a feature, and you'd think with how quick Meta is to copy everything
everyone else is doing, they'd have done it the next day.

These issues combined will slow or even halt adoption of the metaverse as a
space to work or live.

## The metaverse is clearly a marketing ploy
This goes without saying, but people are starting to realize their data isn't
safe on Facebook. Because of that, Facebook is losing market share.

The idea of a metaverse was concocted as a way to gain those and many other
users who either left or never used Facebook. Think about it: if everyone but
the privacy concerned people start using the metaverse for everything, sooner or
later, it'll become so inconvenient to not be in the metaverse, that the
skeptics will have to fold and join anyway. Facebook always has (and always will)
only care about your data; a leopard never changes its spots.

## Mark Zuckerberg is ruining his company.
A lot of news has surfaced recently about big tech cutting large volumes of
employees loose, and it started with Meta. This sort of shift, where
"underperformers" are laid off on short notice is a sign of a lack of funding.
This indicates that Meta has become far less profitable since the announcement
of the metaverse, meaning perhaps people aren't actually excited about the
metaverse, and see it as a joke.

People are also tired of the constant NFT bullshit, and Meta has promised NFT
trading will have a place in the metaverse. I think Meta failed to read the room
and lost a lot of business as a result, which isn't good. Even worse is they're
doubling down on it.

## It's not all bad
I don't oppose the idea of the metaverse. It would make remote work a whole lot
more interesting and probably a bit easier. I'd be able to sit virtually and do
pair programming with my coworkers from across the world. My problem with it is
mostly Facebook, and also that we aren't ready to handle this kind of VR
infrastructure.

I feel like Facebook will only make this into a dystopia where the potential
exists for so much better with this kind of tech. The Oculus headset already
locks users out whose Facebook accounts have been suspended, they can easily
blacklist someone from getting a job if all jobs become virtual, and searching
for a metaverse job will become an arms race for who has the best equipment and
bandwidth.
