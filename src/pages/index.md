## About Me

I'm a 21-year-old full-stack engineer from Springfield Missouri. I've been
programming since I was 9 when I learned Java and HTML. Nowadays, I'm passionate
about decentralized software and I spend most of my time experimenting with new
paradigms and exploring their use cases in consumer software.

In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and playing the
guitar and trombone. My favorite genres are EDM, metal, and rap, and I love when
these genres are combined in interesting ways. I love all animals but cats are
my favorite <3

## Skills

I don't know who I am. I don't know what I want. If you're looking for code, I
can tell you I don't have many projects, but what I do have are a very
particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills
that make me a nightmare for computers. If you let me work on a project with
you, that will be the end of it - I will push clean, performant code... but if
you don't, I will look for you, I will find you... and I will hug you.

Just go look at [my GitHub](https://github.com/LizAinslie) lol
